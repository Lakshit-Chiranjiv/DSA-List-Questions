# Arrays

### *Maximum and Minimum Element in an Array - LQ12*

- Simple Linear search method - traversing and checking each element.
- Dividing the array in 2 halves until there are just less than equal to 2 elements and then comparing the max and min of each divided set - divide and conquer - recursion.
- Comparing 2 elements at a time by traversing.
