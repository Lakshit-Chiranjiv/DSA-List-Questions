# intuition:
# 1. It is a partition DP problem. The dp[i] represents the number of ways to partition the string s[i:] into valid numbers in the range [1, k].
# 2. The dp[i] can be calculated by the sum of dp[j] where j is the index of the first character of the next valid number.
# 3. We iterate from the end of the string to the beginning. For each index i, we check if the substring s[i:j+1] is a valid number. If it is, we add dp[j+1] to dp[i].
# 4. The dp[0] is the final answer.

# solution:
# 1. Initialize the dp array of size n+1 with all zeros.
# 2. Set dp[n] = 1 as there is only one way to partition the empty string.
# 3. Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning. If the current character is '0', we skip it as '0' cannot be the first digit of a valid number.
# 4. Otherwise, we set num = 0 and j = i. We iterate from j to the end of the string. If the substring s[i:j+1] is a valid number, we add dp[j+1] to num and increment j by 1.
# 5. After the inner loop, we set dp[i] = num % (10 ** 9 + 7).
# 6. Return dp[0].

# Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the string s as we need to iterate through the string and check if the substring is a valid number.
# Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string s as we need to store the dp array.
